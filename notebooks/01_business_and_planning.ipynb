    "\n",
    "## 1. Problem Framing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Early identification of individuals at risk is critical for preventive healthcare and timely medical intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Type\n",
    "**Binary Classification**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "Develop a supervised machine learning model to predict the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease based on clinical and lifestyle features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features\n",
    "- **Objective features**: Age, height, weight, gender\n",
    "- **Examination features**: Blood pressure (systolic/diastolic), cholesterol, glucose\n",
    "- **Subjective features**: Smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity\n",
    "\n",
    "### Target Variable\n",
    "- `cardio`: 0 (No CVD) or 1 (CVD present)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Success Metrics\n",
    "- **Primary**: Recall (minimize false negatives - missing sick patients)\n",
    "- **Secondary**: Precision, F1-Score, ROC-AUC"

    "## 2. Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Problem\n",
    "Healthcare systems face significant burden from CVD due to high prevalence, treatment costs, and complications. Early risk identification can reduce costs and improve patient outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Value Proposition\n",
    "1. **Identify High-Risk Patients**: Enable doctors to focus on patients needing intervention\n",
    "2. **Reduce Healthcare Costs**: Prevention is cheaper than emergency care\n",
    "3. **Improve Patient Outcomes**: Early intervention saves lives\n",
    "4. **Data-Driven Decisions**: Remove guesswork from risk assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stakeholders\n",
    "- **Doctors/Cardiologists**: Need accurate predictions for preventive care\n",
    "- **Hospital Management**: Want to reduce emergency admissions\n",
    "- **Patients**: Need correct diagnosis to avoid misclassification\n",
    "- **Data Science Team**: Need clean, reliable data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Success Criteria\n",
    "- **Technical**: Recall ≥ 80% (catch most sick patients)\n",
    "- **Business**: Model must be interpretable (doctors need to understand \"why\")\n",
    "- **Deployment**: Model must work in real-time clinical setting\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resources\n",
    "- **Data**: 70,000 patient records\n",
    "- **Tools**: Python, Scikit-learn, FastAPI (deployment)\n"

    "\n",
    "| Stakeholder | Primary Concern | Model Requirement |\n",
    "|-------------|----------------|-------------------|\n",
    "| Doctors | Early detection of high-risk patients | High recall, interpretability |\n",
    "| Hospital Management | Cost reduction, efficiency | Accurate predictions, scalability |\n",
    "| Patients | Avoid misdiagnosis | Balance recall and precision |\n",
    "| Compliance/Ethics | Fairness, bias mitigation | Transparency, audit trail |\n",
    "| Data Science Team | Data quality, feasibility | Clean labels, sufficient data |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ethical Considerations\n",
    "- Model is **decision-support**, not diagnostic tool\n",
    "- Must explain predictions (feature importance)\n",
    "- Monitor for bias across demographics\n",
    "- Ensure patient privacy (no PII in model)"

    "4. Feature engineering → Create BMI, pulse pressure\n",
    "5. Baseline model → Establish performance floor\n",
    "6. Model selection → Try multiple algorithms\n",
    "7. Hyperparameter tuning → GridSearchCV\n",
    "8. Evaluation → Focus on recall\n",
    "9. Deployment → Pickle + monitoring + retraining\n",
